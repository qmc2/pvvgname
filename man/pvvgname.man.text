NAME
  pvvgname - finds the names of the volume groups that physical volumes belong to

SYNOPSIS
  pvvgname [-l|--long] device [device ...]

  pvvgname -v|--version

  pvvgname -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
  This simple utility reads the names of the Linux LVM2 volume groups (VGs) that one or more physical
  volumes (PVs) belong to directly from their metadata areas (MDAs) stored on disk, and prints their
  names to stdout.
  
  PVs are specified as device paths, for example /dev/sdc, /dev/mapper/mpatha or /dev/sd*.

  Note that because pvvgname has to read from the given (block) devices directly, it has to be run as
  root or via sudo.

  What is it good for? Well, under normal circumstances you would just use standard LVM2 commands like
  pvdisplay(8) or pvs(8) to determine the VGs that arbitrary PVs belong to. 'Normal' here means that
  there are no duplicate PV UUIDs present which would cause those commands to basically fail and return
  irritating information. Situations like these can easily occur when disks are cloned in the storage
  back-end or otherwise copied 1:1 on block-level. Because pvvgname reads the data directly from the
  MDA stored on disk and doesn't require a valid VG structure (as most LVM2 commands do), it will still
  be able to gather the correct information.

EXIT STATUS
  0 - No error: The VG name is printed to stdout. The name can be empty if the PV is not
  currently part of a VG.

  1 - Some error occurred: An error message is printed to stderr.

OPTIONS
  -l|--long  Enables long output, that is, pvvgname prints the device path followed by the VG name
	     followed by the VG UUID (separated by tab-characters)

  -h|--help  Prints the usage help and exits

  -v|--version  Prints the pvvgname version and exits
