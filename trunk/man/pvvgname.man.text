NAME
  pvvgname - find the name of the volume group (VG) that a physical volume (PV) belongs to

SYNOPSIS
  pvvgname [-l|--long] device [device ...]

  pvvgname [-h|--help] [-v|--version]

DESCRIPTION
  This simple utility reads the name of the Linux LVM2 volume groups (VGs) that one or more physical
  volumes (PVs) belong to directly from their metadata areas stored on disk, and prints their names
  to stdout. PVs are specified as device paths, for example /dev/sdc, /dev/mapper/mpatha or /dev/sd*.

  Note that because pvvgname has to read from the given (block) devices directly, it has to be run as
  root or via sudo.

EXIT STATUS
  0 - No error: The VG name is printed to stdout. The name can be empty if the PV is not
  currently part of a VG.

  1 - Some error occurred: An error message is be printed to stderr.

OPTIONS
  -l|--long  Enables long output, that is, print the device path before the volume group name
             (separated by a tab-character)

  -h|--help  Prints the usage help and exits

  -v|--version  Prints the pvvgname version and exits
