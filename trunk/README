pvvgname - v1.1
---------------

This utility reads the name of the Linux LVM2 volume group (VG) that a physical
volume (PV) belongs to directly from the metadata area (MDA) stored on disk,
and prints it to stdout.

Building and installing
-----------------------

All you need to build the program is gcc and make. Then just run

$ make

to create the binary (pvvgname), followed by

$ sudo make install

to "install" it. The binary will be copied to /usr/local/sbin because of the
default PREFIX, which is /usr/local. If you want to install it elsewhere,
specify a different PREFIX.

For example

$ sudo make install PREFIX=/usr

would install it to /usr/sbin instead.

Usage
-----

As pvvgname opens the respective (block) device directly it has to be run as
root, or via sudo. Example:

$ sudo pvdisplay /dev/sdc
  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdc
  VG Name               data
  PV Size               3,64 TiB / not usable 2,82 MiB
  Allocatable           yes 
  PE Size               4,00 MiB
  Total PE              953861
  Free PE               429573
  Allocated PE          524288
  PV UUID               rnML2E-nc2n-R4gy-9GEA-pJbU-JngR-jF4GwJ

$ sudo pvvgname /dev/sdc
data

If you run the tool on a block device that is no LVM2 PV, pvvgname will spit
a corresponding error:

$ sudo pvvgname /dev/sdd
ERROR: /dev/sdd doesn't appear to be an LVM2 physical volume

Alternatively, if LVM2 metadata exists on the device (which makes it a PV as per
definition) but it's not part of a VG, pvvgname will return an empty string (and
return code 0).

Shell return codes
------------------

0 - No error

    The VG name is printed to stdout. Note that it can be empty if the PV is
    currently not part of a VG.

1 - Some error occurred

    An error message is printed to stderr.

What is it good for?
--------------------

Well, there are situations where pvdisplay doesn't work correctly. Huh?!

The case that we stumbled upon was with duplice PV UUID caused by LUN cloning
in the storage back-end. An easy/standard way of still finding out which PV
belongs to which VG doesn't seem to exist in such a case, which was the initial
motivation for writing this tool (since we needed this information badly within
an automated VG cloning operation).

Because we read the LVM2 metadata directly from the block device - without
having to take the actual VG structure into account - we can still get to that
information although LVM2's commands (pvdisplay et al.) are confused.
